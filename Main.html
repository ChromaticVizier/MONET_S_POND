          By the 1890s, the financial worries that had plagued Monet for most of his life were coming to an
          era and he was able to buy Giverny - in fact he had established some wealth and was able to lavish
          his money on his own home and garden for the first time. It would result in a stunning and unique
          property, which included the most exciting garden - designed by the artist - and its Water Lily Pond.
          Planning permission was granted in 1893 and he spent much of his focus on the bridge in his works.
          Incredibly, he only painted about three works of the lily pond up to 1897, This work, from 1899,
          is exquisite in its composition of background trees, weeping willow, and the bridge, which underwent
          many alterations up to 1910. The pond here is literally obliterated by vegetation and lilies.
          It is composed of short brushstrokes - a familiar method during his mature years. In a letter, Monet
          described how he had planted the water lilies for fun - he had never intended painting them, however,
          once they established themselves they almost became his only source of inspiration. He wrote: "I saw,
          all of a sudden, that my pond had become enchanted... Since then, I have had no other model."
